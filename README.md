# Google Stock Prediction – Closing Price Analysis

## Project Motivation
Google is one of the largest most influential and successful technology companies in the world, making it a highly relevant and significant dataset for financial analysis. Analyzing and predicting its stock performance can provide insights into the success or failure of new technologies and their potential impact on the market. The closing price of a stock is the final price at which a stock is traded on a given trading day. It's one of the most commonly used prices to analyze a stock's performance. Overall, choosing Google stock prediction as a dataset offers a unique opportunity to gain insights into the technology industry, market trends, and potential investment opportunities related to one of the world's largest companies.

## Project Overview
This project utilizes R programming to analyze and predict Google's stock price trends by applying data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization techniques.

## Key Features & Techniques
Data Loading & Exploration – Reads and summarizes Google's stock data.

Data Cleaning – Detects and removes null values and outliers to improve accuracy.

Visualization – Uses histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to analyze trends.

Feature Selection – Implements correlation matrices and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for optimal predictor selection.

Data Normalization – Applies min-max scaling to standardize stock attributes.

Discretization – Categorizes trading volume into low, medium, and high levels.
